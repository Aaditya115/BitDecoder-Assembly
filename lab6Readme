#6.

Name: Aaditya Gupta

Total Time: 8 hours

Short description: The lab was mostly fine besides this one bug where create_key would create the correct 8-bit key and then the 8-bit key would go to 0, in scanf. This took me way too long to fix, and it was a really simple fix.

GDB: I used GDB to trace the value of key throughout the program and find out where it was going to 0.

I jumped back to lab2, to understand the logic behind bit roatation.
