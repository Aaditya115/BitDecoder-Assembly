This project is a bit decoder implemented using both C programming and x86-64 assembly. The main functionality of the program revolves around decoding a 4-digit binary key, transforming it into an 8-bit key, and providing bit manipulation operations such as rotating the key left and right. The project focuses on low-level operations, combining C with assembly language, and provides hands-on experience with bitwise operations, memory management, and debugging on x86-64 architecture.

The core objective of this project is to take user input, decode it into an 8-bit key, and provide two key manipulation operations (rotation to the left and right) in assembly. The program demonstrates how low-level bit manipulation and system calls (e.g., getchar, printf) can be used together in a real-world context.

Features
Binary Key Decoding: Takes 4 user-input digits and transforms them into an 8-bit key using bitwise operations.

Bit Rotation: Allows users to rotate the generated 8-bit key either to the left or to the right by one position, simulating basic encryption techniques.

C + Assembly Integration: The project combines higher-level logic written in C with lower-level bitwise manipulations implemented in x86-64 assembly.
